1. Get the latest version of Neovim (Not from ubuntu) and place it in the folder /opt/nvim/nvim(executable).
2. Make sure that NeoVim is in the shell path.
3. Create a directory in your home called ~/.config/
4. Clone this repo into ~/.config/ and rename the folder to nvim. Now the path should look like ~/.config/nvim/
